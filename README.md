# NetCoreConsoleAppBase

This is base template for .NET Core console application with configured Dependency Injection and environment settings with different appsettings.{environmentname}.json file.

By default this project is configured with Development and Production environments, but you can add new environments easily by adding new section in launchSettings.json with new environment (similar to other environments) and appsettings.{environmentname}.json with settings for new environment.

It was based on https://espressocoder.com/2018/12/03/build-a-console-app-in-net-core-like-a-pro/ but if you want finished code, simply copy this repo and change project, solution and namespaces names according to your needs and code what you want from that point.
